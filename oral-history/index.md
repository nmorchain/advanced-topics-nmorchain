 # The Oral History of Hip-Hop’s Birth

__Hip-Hop’s Origin Story__

On August 11th, 1973 DJ Kool Herc hosted a back to school block party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue [<a href= "javascript:seek(16)">See a surviving invite to the party</a>]. It is there, sometime between 9 o’clock at night and 4 in the morning, that Hip-Hop was born. During the “Back to School Jam”, DJ Kool Herc borrowed a technique from Manhattan’s Downtown Disco-Techs—the use of two turntables so that they would not have to stop the music when changing records. However, Herc put his own twist on it. Herc used the two turntables to extend the instrumental breaks (the parts of the songs where the singing stops, but the music continues)—also known as “The Breaks”—on the records [<a href= "javascript:seek(20)">Listen to an Instrumental Break</a>]. Instead of allowing The Breaks to play to an end, Herc would mix between them to create a continuous dance rhythm. This technique would be dubbed <a href= "javascript:seek(38)">“The Merry Go Round”</a> by Herc and would form the basis of Hip-Hop. As Rose (1994) explains:

>"DJ Kool Herc separated rap music from other popular musics and set the stage for further innovation. Kool Herc was known for his massive stereo system speakers (which he named the Herculords) and his practice of extending obscure instrumental breaks that created an endless collage of peak dance beats named b-beats or break-beats. This collage of break-beats stood in sharp contrast to Eurodisco's unbroken dance beat that dominated the dance scene in the midto late 1970s."[^1]

Hip-Hop would continue to go unnoticed by the mainstream media and music industry until independent music producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Robinson">Sylvia Robinson</a> released The Sugar Hill Gang’s single “Rapper’s Delight” in 1979 [<a href="javascript:seek(155)">Listen to Big Bank Hank tell the story of how he met Sylvia Robinson</a>]. The single would be the first Hip-Hop song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 list, peaking at number 36. In the six years that followed the genre would continue to gain momentum and the music industry would take notice. This momentum would peak in 1981 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_(band)">Blondie’s</a> single “Rapture” reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 list. Importantly, the song featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Harry">Debbie Harry</a> rapping during the song’s second verse[<a href= "javascript:seek(195)">Listen to Debbie Harry rap</a>]. This would be the first time a song with Hip-Hop elements would reach number 1. 

Debbie Harry would credit her knowledge of Hip-Hop to Fred “Fab Five Freddy” Brathwaite. Fab Five Freddy was a member of the Brooklyn-based graffiti group the Fabulous 5 who were known for painting New York City subway cars. As graffiti artists such as Freddy began to gain acclaim and influence with the Downtown art critics and arthouses, they brought Hip-Hop with them into the affluent Downtown core of New York City. Using the influence he had gained through graffiti, Fab Five Freddy became the bridge between the graffiti and rap scene and the Downtown art scenes acting as an ambassador for Hip-Hop culture. It is in in Downtown art scence that Freddy would meet Debbie Harry and introduce her to the Uptown New York Hip-Hop scene. Soon after they would <a href= "javascript:seek(215)">forge a friendship and Harry would immortalize Freddy in Rapture's lyrics</a>: 

> "Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly <br>
DJ spinning I said "My My"<br>
Flash is fast, Flash is cool<br>
François c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
<br>And you don't stop, sure shot"
<br>\- "Rapture"[^2]

Within a few years <a href="javascript:seek(51)">Afrika Bambaataa</a>, DJ and founder of the Zulu Nation, would continue to build on the foundation which Herc had laid. Inspired by the Punk and Newwave musicians who would attend his performances, Bambaataa used the beats of European discobands such as Kraftwerk and mixed them with <a href= "javascript:seek(250)">rock, jazz, funk, and soul</a> to create a sound which was unique to him at the time. This would culminate with the creation of "Planet Rock" a song produced by Afrika Bambaataa which would <a href="javascript:seek(290)"> a sample  Kraftwerk's song "Trans-Europe Express"</a> and recieve critical acclaim: 

>'"Planet Rock," a single by Afrika Bambaataa and Soul Sonic Force on New York's independent Tommy Boy label, was perhaps the most influential black pop record of 1982. It combined the street-corner rapping style that was breaking out of black inner-city neighborhoods, influencing both the black pop mainstream and several leading white new-wave rockers... Grand Master Flash himself has conceded, the idea of combining rapping with sophisticated electronic dance music originated with Afrika Bambaataa and "Planet Rock."'[^3]

While Hip-Hop had entered the World’s stage, the music, and the culture surrounding it, faced much resistance. Graffiti, Break Dancing, and Hip-Hop were, in the eyes of many, an eye sore, rather than an art. [<a href="javascript:seek(355)">For example, listen to New York City Police Officers disucss graffiti</a>] In the case of graffiti, there were significant efforts made by the New York City Police Department and policymakers to supress graffiti artists and remove graffiti from the subway system and surrounding areas. A brief scan of articles from the mid-80s provide plenty of examples of the administrative efforts taken against spray-painting within <a href="https://nyti.ms/29pBuab">New York City</a>, as well as surrounding locations like the town of <a href="https://nyti.ms/29wOis1">Islip</a> and the county of <a href="https://nyti.ms/29DlTmH">Westchester</a>. Perhaps most extreme was the plan which the Mayor of New York City at the time, Ed Koch, suggested: the use of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ed-koch-wanted-to-use-wolves-to-stop-graffiti-2013-2">wild wolves to guard the subway system</a> from graffiti artists. 

>Got a bum education, double-digit inflation<br>
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station<br>
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane<br>
Sometimes I think I'm going insane<br>
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge<br>
I'm trying not to lose my head<br>
It's like a jungle sometimes<br>
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under<br>
\- "The Message"[^4]

[^4]: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYMkEMCHtJ4">Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, "The Message" (Sugarhill Records, 1982)

Unlike the upbeat, dance oriented lyrics on The Sugar Hill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” and Afrika Bambaataa’s “Planet Rock”, <a href="javascript:seek(405)">Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five elected to use “The Message” to explore the social, economic, cultural, and political issues which they faced</a>. From the mistreatment of graffiti artists and their art by the New York City Police Department to the disproportionate black unemployment rate, “The Message” sought to use the attention Hip-Hop had gained to shed light on the social injustices which minorities faced in America.

In 1980 the United States would reach “double-digit inflation” at 13.5% and the country would officially enter into a recession. During the recession Blacks and Hispanics would suffer proportionally greater employment decline than whites. In the first quarter of 1981, the white unemployment rate sat at 6.5% whereas the black unemployment rate was more than double that at 14.7%. Hispanics were also disproportionately unemployed when compared to whites, with their unemployment rate siting at 11%. By the fourth quarter of 1982, the black unemployment rate had risen to 20.4% and the Hispanic unemployment rate reached 15.2%. By contrast, during the same quarter the white unemployment rate was only 9.5%. Black teenagers found it particularly hard to find work during this recession with approximately 50% of them being unemployed during the entirety of 1982.[^5]

The second line, “Can’t take the train to the job, there’s a strike at the station”, makes reference to the 1980 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_New_York_City_transit_strike#">New York City transit strike</a>. On April 1, 1980 around 33,00 members of the Transport Works Union walked off their jobs halting all subway and bus lines in the five boroughs of New York City for twelve days. The strike would be particularly hard on works in the manufacturing industry and other low-income positions as they were less likely to be able to afford alternative modes of transit. The working classes’ plight of struggling to “keep from going under”—both psychologically and economically—was exasperated during this strike as it prevented them from being able to get into work without paying for taxis or other forms of transport which they could not afford. 

Rappers Melle Mel and Duke Bootee’s decision to tackle these complex social issues on “The Message” also marked a shift in Hip-Hop culture. Prior to “The Message”, DJs had been the stars of the music. Thus, new songs were primarily produced by mixing and scratching without any lyrical content. However, in “The Message” it was the content of the lyrics and the performances of the emcees which played the star role. With the success of “The Message” Hip-Hop would evolve once again. Emcee’s would become the genre’s stars and artists would begin to focus more heavily on the lyrics rather than the production of the beats which accompanied them. [<a href="javascript:seek(68)">Listen to Casanova Fly and DJ Kool Herc talk about the evolution of emceeing.</a>]

 __The Trouble with Telling Hip-Hop’s History__


The study of Hip-Hop can be both difficult and confusing. On one hand, music and cultural critics praise Hip-Hop’s role as an educational tool which draws attention to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20064000?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">woman's right issues and woman empowerment movements</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20063999?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">the problems of racism and class-division</a>, and economic oppression within the various communities which Hip-Hop artists live in (see Alridge (2005) and Phillips *et all* (2005)). On the other hand, news media attention on Hip-Hop seems fixated on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi5b_j-c5Ng">instances of violence at rap concerts</a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/robin-thicke-pharrell-sue-over-blurred-lines-188052/">DJs and producers’ illegal uses of music samples</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT7EVjyV_rg">gangsta rap’s violent lyrics</a>. There is also deep divide within the Hip-Hop community itself. Rappers will sometimes praise the work of gangsta rappers while simultaneously consider it to be a negative influence on black youths (Rose 1994, pg. 20). However, that is not to say Hip-Hop’s contradictory behaviour should not be seen as a lack of intellectual insight, rather it emphasises the complexity of the social, economic, cultural, and political issues which the musical genre see itself as confronting.

While the rise of Hip-Hop is well documented, much of what is known about Hip-Hop’s infancy comes from the stories told by those who were there and the few recordings which have survived since. Thus, if one wants to understand how Funk, Jazz, and Disco evolved into Hip-Hop, they must rely on the stories told by those who were there. The challenge with relying on these stories is that they often conflict. While the canonical story, that this paper tells, is that Hip-Hop was born in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx">South Bronx</a>, those from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">Queens</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem">Harlem</a> often lay claim to the invention of Hip-Hop. Thus, the story of Hip-Hop’s genesis is told differently depending on which region of New York the storyteller is from. For example, while those from the South Bronx credit the invention of Hip-Hop to DJ Kool Herc, if you ask someone from Brooklyn who invented Hip-Hop, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_Flowers">Grandmaster Flowers</a>, while lesser known, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G13bR0B0-8&t">is often named</a>. Hence, writers of Hip-Hop’s origins who seek to offer a unified canon of the its origins must often choose which stories they want to retell. 

Retelling Hip-Hop’s genesis, thus, highlights the difficulties historians face when working with oral history. Oral historians work to uncover truths and preserve compelling histories which might become lost. However, the nature of oral history requires that those providing the oral history offer accurate representations of the event(s) they are retelling. As the author of *The Sugar Girls*, Duncan Barrett, recalls from his work recording oral histories:

> "On two occasions, it became clear that a subject was trying to mislead us about what happened – telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. The stories we were told were not always ‘innocent’ historical facts – often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives."[^6]

Thus, as cases such as Barrett’s highlight, an oral historian’s ability to uncover the truth relies on the truthfulness of the testimonies they are provided. Bridging the gap between fact and fiction can, then, be difficult, if oral historians do not have objective information required to pull apart truth from embellishments and narrative-driven stories. Hip-Hop then, provides a unique challenge to historians as the information provided can be, and often is, only fragments of the whole story. Thus, retelling the origins of Hip-Hop is important not only to those who have a love for the genre, but also as a case study of the challenges oral historians face in their field.
