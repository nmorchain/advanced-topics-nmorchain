 # The Oral History of Hip-Hop’s Birth

__S.1. Hip-Hop’s Origin Story__

On August 11th, 1973 DJ Kool Herc hosted a back to school block party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue [<a href= "javascript:seek(16)">See a surviving invite to the party here</a>]. It is there sometime between 9 o’clock at night and 4 in the morning, that Hip-Hop was born. During the “Back to School Jam”, DJ Kool Herc borrowed a technique from Manhattan’s Downtown Disco-Techs—the use of two turntables so that they would not have to stop the music when changing records. However, Herc put his own twist on it. Herc used the two turntables to extend the instrumental breaks (the parts of the songs where the singing stops, but the music continues)—also known as “The Breaks”—on the records [<a href= "javascript:seek(20)">Listen to an Instrumental Break here</a>]. Instead of allowing The Breaks to play to an end, Herc would mix between them to create a continuous dance rhythm. This technique would be dubbed <a href= "javascript:seek(38)">“The Merry Go Round”</a> by Herc and would form the basis of Hip-Hop.

Hip-Hop would continue to go unnoticed by the mainstream media and music industry until independent music producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Robinson">Sylvia Robinson</a> released The Sugar Hill Gang’s single “Rapper’s Delight” in 1979 [<a href="javascript:seek(155)">Listen to Big Bank Hank tell the story of how he meet Sylvia Robinson</a>]. The single would be the first Hip-Hop song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 list, peaking at number 36. In the six years that followed the genre would continue to gain momentum and the music industry would take notice. This momentum would peak in 1981 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_(band)">Blondie’s</a> single “Rapture” reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 list. Importantly, the song featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Harry">Debbie Harry</a> rapping during the song’s second verse[<a href= "javascript:seek(195)">Listen to Debbie Harry rap here]</a>. This would be the first time a song with Hip-Hop elements would reach number 1. 

Debbie Harry would credit her knowledge of Hip-Hop to Fred “Fab Five Freddy” Brathwaite. Fab Five Freddy was a member of the Brooklyn-based graffiti group the Fabulous 5 who were known for painting New York City subway cars. Using the influence his art had gained him, Fab Five Freddy became the bridge between the graffiti and rap scene and the Downtown art scenes acting as an ambassador for Hip-Hop culture. 

While Hip-Hop had entered the World’s stage, the music, and the culture surrounding it, faced much resistance. Graffiti, Break Dancing, and Hip-Hop were, in the eyes of many, an eye sore, rather than an art. [<a href="javascript:seek(355)">Listen to New York City Police Officers disucss graffiti</a>] In the case of graffiti, there were significant efforts made by the New York City Police Department and Policy makers to supress graffiti artists and remove graffiti from the subway system and surrounding areas. A brief scan of articles from the mid-80s provide plenty of examples of the administrative efforts taken against spray-painting within <a href="https://nyti.ms/29pBuab">New York City</a>, as well as surrounding locations like the town of <a href="https://nyti.ms/29wOis1">Islip</a> and the county of <a href="https://nyti.ms/29DlTmH">Westchester</a>. For example, Mayor of New York City at the time, Ed Koch, wanted to use <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ed-koch-wanted-to-use-wolves-to-stop-graffiti-2013-2">wild wolves to guard the subway system</a> from graffiti artists. Thus, much of the official documents and media coverage surrounding Hip-Hop culture in the 1970s and 1980s is highly critical and often only provides analysis of the art and culture which are surface level at best. 

 __S.2. The Trouble with Telling Hip-Hop’s History__

While the rise of Hip-Hop is well documented, much of what is known about Hip-Hop’s infancy comes from the stories told by those who were there and the few recordings which have survived since. Thus, if one wants to understand how Funk, Jazz, and Disco evolved into Hip-Hop, they must rely on the stories told by those who were there. The challenge with relying on these stories is that they often conflict. While the canonical story, that this paper tells, is that Hip-Hop was born in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx">South Bronx</a>, those from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">Queens</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem">Harlem</a> often lay claim to the invention of Hip-Hop. Thus, the story of Hip-Hop’s genesis is told differently depending on which region of New York the storyteller is from. For example, while those from the South Bronx credit the invention of Hip-Hop to DJ Kool Herc, if you ask someone from Brooklyn who invented Hip-Hop, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_Flowers">Grandmaster Flowers</a>, while lesser known, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G13bR0B0-8&t">is often named</a>. Hence, writers of Hip-Hop’s origins who seek to offer a unified canon of the its origins must often choose which stories they want to retell.

Retelling Hip-Hop’s genesis, thus, highlights the difficulties historians face when working with oral history. Oral historians work to uncover truths and preserve compelling histories which might become lost. However, the nature of oral history requires that those providing the oral history offer accurate representations of the event(s) they are retelling. As the author of *The Sugar Girls*, Duncan Barrett, recalls from his work recording oral histories:

> "On two occasions, it became clear that a subject was trying to mislead us about what happened – telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. The stories we were told were not always ‘innocent’ historical facts – often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives."[^second]

[^second]: <a href="http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/oral-history-creative-non-fiction-telling-the-lives-of-the-sugar-girls/">Barrett, D. (2012, August 1). Oral History & Creative Non-Fiction: Telling the Lives of the Sugar Girls. Retrieved December 9, 2019, from http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/oral-history-creative-non-fiction-telling-the-lives-of-the-sugar-girls/.</a>

Thus, as cases such as Barrett’s highlight, an oral historian’s ability to uncover the truth relies on the truthfulness of the testimonies they are provided. Bridging the gap between fact and fiction can, then, be difficult, if oral historians do not have objective information required to pull apart truth from embellishments and narrative-driven stories. Hip-Hop then, provides a unique challenge to historians as the information provided can be, and often is, only fragments of the whole story. Thus, retelling the origins of Hip-Hop is important not only to those who have a love for the genre, but also as a case study of the challenges oral historians face in their field.

The study of Hip-Hop can be both difficult and confusing. On one hand, music and cultural critics praise Hip-Hop’s role as an educational tool which draws attention to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20064000?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">woman's right issues and woman empowerment movements</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20063999?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">the problems of racism and class-division</a>, and economic oppression within the various communities which Hip-Hop artists live in (see Alridge (2005) and Phillips *et all* (2005)). On the other hand, news media attention on Hip-Hop seems fixated on instances of violence at rap concerts, DJs and producers’ illegal uses of music samples, and gangsta rap’s violent lyrics. There is also deep divide within the Hip-Hop community itself. Rappers will sometimes praise the work of gangsta rappers while simultaneously consider it to be a negative influence on black youths (Rose 1994, pg. 20). Hip-Hop’s contradictory behaviour should not be seen as a lack of intellectual insight, but, rather, emphasises the complexity of the social, economic, cultural, and political issues which the musical genre see itself as confronting.
