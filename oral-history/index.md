 # The Oral History of Hip-Hop’s Birth
1520 Sedgwick Avenue--the birthplace of Hip-Hop. In the 1970s the New York music scene was evolving and, by the early 1980s, a new genre of music was born: Hip-Hop. While an auditory revolution was going on in places like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx">South Bronx</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">Queens</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, much of the world was ignorant of the noise. Thus, much of our knowledge on Hip-Hop's infancy comes from the stories told by those who were there. From the <a href="https://thesource.com/2018/08/11/today-in-hip-hop-history-kool-hercs-party-at-1520-sedgewick-avenue-45-years-ago-marks-the-foundation-of-the-culture-known-as-hip-hop/?fbclid=IwAR0nKHrjiwVAIBGVteoAGIoqlGZ4iKLMrxctVJN_Tnifl-soPg2HAdSFEk4">DJ Kool Herc's block parties in front of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue</a> to graffiti artist <a href=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fab-5-freddy-mn0000165003>Fab Five Freddy's</a> meetings with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_(band)">Blondie</a>, this page looks at the events which transpired that gave us the biggest music genre in the world—Hip-Hop. 

On August 11th, 1973 DJ Kool Herc hosted a back to school block party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. [<a href= "javascript:seek(01)">Listen Here</a>] It is there sometime between 9 o’clock at night and 4 in the morning, that Hip-Hop was born. During the “Back to School Jam”, DJ Kool Herc borrowed a technique from Manhattan’s Downtown Disco-Techs—the use of two turntables so that they would not have to stop the music when changing records. However, Herc put his own twist on it. Herc used them to extend the instrumental breaks (the parts of the songs where the singing stops, but the music continues)—simply known as “The Breaks”—on the records. Herc’s next innovation would be “The Merry Go Round”. Instead of allowing The Breaks to play to an end, Herc would mix between them to create a continuous dance rhythm.[^first] This would form the basis of Hip-Hop.

Over the course of the 1970s and early 1980s, Hip-Hop would continue to evolve, forming a culture around it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing">Break-Dancing</a> (named after The Breaks) and those who performed it, known as B (Break) Boys, would become a staple at the Block Parties and Nightclubs where Hip-Hop was performed. Graffiti would take over the New York City subways and streets. As Graffiti artists began to gain acclaim and influence with the Downtown art critics and arthouses, they brought Hip-Hop with them into the affluent Downtown core of New York City. Fred “Fab Five Freddy” Brathwaite, was a member of the Brooklyn-based graffiti group the Fabulous 5, who became known for painting New York City Subway cars. Using the influence <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/fab-5-freddy">his art</a> had gained him, Fab Five Freddy became the bridge between the graffiti and rap scene and the Downtown art scenes. There he would meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stein">Chris Stein</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Harry">Debbie Harry</a> of Blondie, who would immortalize Freddy in their 1981 hit <a href="https://youtu.be/pHCdS7O248g">Rapture</a>.[^second]

[^second]: For more about the process behind the creation of Rapture, see <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rap-in-blondies-rapture-11560178671">Marc Myers’ Wall Street Journal Article</a>.

On March 28, 1981, Rapture would reach Number 1 on the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/blondie/chart-history/HSI/song/31066">U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart</a> and would be the first song to reach Number 1 which featured elements of Hip-Hop. Rapture’s success introduced the world to a style of music which Uptown New York had been aware of for almost 10 years—Hip-Hop. Following the release of Rapture, Hip-Hop began to receive more attention from media outlets and has continued to grow into, what is now, the biggest music genre in the world. [<a href="javascript:seek(192)">Listen Here</a>]

While Hip-Hop had entered the World’s Stage, it was, and still is, more than just a music genre—it was a counter-culture movement. Hip-Hop, and the culture surrounding it, faced much resistance. Graffiti, Break Dancing, and Hip-Hop were, in the eyes of many, seen as an eye sore, rather than an art. [<a href="javascript:seek(317)">Listen Here</a>] For example, there were significant efforts made by the New York City Police Department and Policy makers to supress graffiti artists and remove graffiti from the subway system and surrounding areas. A brief scan of articles from the mid-80s provide plenty of examples of the administrative efforts taken against spray-painting within <a href="https://nyti.ms/29pBuab">New York City</a>, as well as surrounding locations like the town of <a href="https://nyti.ms/29wOis1">Islip</a> and the county of <a href="https://nyti.ms/29DlTmH">Westchester</a>. Thus, much of the official documents and media coverage surrounding Hip-Hop culture in the 1970s and 1980s is highly critical and often only provides analysis of the art and culture which are surface level at best [<a href="javascript:seek(360)">Listen Here</a>].

While the rise of Hip-Hop is well documented, much of what is known about Hip-Hop’s infancy comes from the stories told by those who were there and the few recordings which have survived since. Thus, if one wants to understand how Funk, Jazz, and Disco evolved into Hip-Hop, they must rely on the stories told by those who were there. The challenge with relying on these stories is that they often conflict. While the canonical story, that this paper tells, is that Hip-Hop was born in the South Bronx, those from Brooklyn, Queens, and Harlem often lay claim to the invention of Hip-Hop. Thus, the story of Hip-Hop’s genesis is told differently depending on which region of New York the storyteller is from. For example, while those from the South Bronx <a href="javascript:seek(30)">credit the invention of Hip-Hop to DJ Kool Herc</a>, if you ask someone from Brooklyn who invented Hip-Hop, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_Flowers">Grandmaster Flowers</a>, while lesser known, is often named. Hence, writers of Hip-Hop’s origins who seek to offer a unified canon of the its origins must often choose which stories they want to retell.

Retelling Hip-Hop’s genesis, thus, highlights the difficulties historians face when working with oral history. Oral historians work to uncover truths and preserve compelling histories which might become lost. However, the nature of oral history requires that those providing the oral history offer accurate representations of the event(s) they are retelling. As the author of The Sugar Girls, Duncan Barrett, recalls from his work recording Oral Histories:
<a href="http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/oral-history-creative-non-fiction-telling-the-lives-of-the-sugar-girls/">On two occasions, it became clear that a subject was trying to mislead us about what happened – telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. The stories we were told were not always ‘innocent’ historical facts – often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives."</a> 
Thus, an oral historian’s ability to uncover the truth relies on the truthfulness of the testimonies they are provided. Bridging the gap between fact and fiction can, then, be difficult if oral historians do not have objective information to pull apart truth from embellishments and narrative-driven stories. Hip-Hop then, provides a unique challenge to historians as the information provided can be, and often is, only fragments of the whole story. Thus, retelling the origins of Hip-Hop is important not only to those who have a love for the genre, but also as a case study of the challenges oral historians face in their field.
