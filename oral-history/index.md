 On August 11th, 1973 DJ Kool Herc hosted a back to school block party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. It is there sometime between 9 o’clock at night and 4 in the morning, that Hip-Hop was born. During the “Back to School Jam”, DJ Kool Herc borrowed a technique from Manhattan’s Downtown Disco-Techs—the use of two turntables so that they would not have to stop the music when changing records. However, Herc put his own twist on it. Herc used them to extend the instrumental breaks (the parts of the songs where the singing stops, but the music continues)—simply known as “The Breaks”—on the records. Herc’s next innovation would be “The Merry Go Round”. Instead of allowing The Breaks to play to an end, Herc would mix between them to create a continuous dance rhythm. This would form the basis of Hip-Hop. 

Over the course of the 1970s and early 1980s, Hip-Hop would continue to evolve, forming a culture around it. Break-Dancing (named after The Breaks) and those who performed it, known as B, or Break, Boys, would become a staple at the Block Parties and Nightclubs where Hip-Hop was performed. Graffiti would take over the New York City subways and streets. As Graffiti artists began to gain acclaim and influence with the Downtown art critics and arthouses, they brought Hip-Hop with them into the affluent Downtown core of New York City. Fred “Fab Five Freddy” Brathwaite, was a member of the Brooklyn-based graffiti group the Fabulous 5, who became known for painting New York City Subway cars. Using the influence his art had gained him, Fab Five Freddy became the bridge between the graffiti and rap scene and the Downtown art scenes. There he would meet Chris Stein and Debbie Harry of Blondie, who would immortalize Freddy in their 1981 hit “Rapture”. 

Rapture would reach Number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and would be the first song to reach Number 1 which featured elements of Hip-Hop. Rapture’s success introduced the world to a style of music which Uptown New York had been aware of for almost 10 years—Hip-Hop. Following the release of Rapture, Hip-Hop began to receive more attention from media outlets and has continued to grow into, what is now, the biggest music genre in the world. 

While Hip-Hop had entered the World’s Stage, it was, and still is, more than just a music genre—it was a counter-culture movement. Hip-Hop, and the culture surrounding it, faced much resistance. Graffiti, Break Dancing, and Hip-Hop were, in the eyes of many, seen as an eye sore, rather than an art. For example, there were significant efforts made by the New York City Police Department and Policy makers to supress graffiti artists and remove graffiti from the subway system and surrounding areas. Thus, much of the official documents and media coverage surrounding Hip-Hop culture in the 1970s and 1980s is highly critical and often only provides analysis of the art and culture which are surface level at best. 

While the raise of Hip-Hop is well documented, much of what is known about Hip-Hop’s infancy comes from the stories told by those who were there and the few recordings which have survived since. Thus, if one wants to understand how Funk, Jazz, and Disco evolved into Hip-Hop, they must rely on the stories told by those who were there.
The challenge with relying on these stories is that they often conflict. While the canonical story, that this paper tells, is that Hip-Hop was born in the South Bronx, those from Brooklyn, Queens, and Harlem often lay claim to the invention of Hip-Hop. Thus, the story of Hip-Hop’s genesis is told differently depending on which region of New York the storyteller is from. For example, while those from the South Bronx credit the invention of Hip-Hop to DJ Kool Herc, if you ask someone from Brooklyn who invented Hip-Hop, Grandmaster Flowers, while lesser known, is often named. Hence, writers of Hip-Hop’s origins who seek to offer a unified canon of the its origins must often choose which stories they want to retell.

Retelling Hip-Hop’s genesis, thus, highlights the difficulties historians face when working with oral history. Oral historians work to uncover truths and preserve compelling histories which might become lost. However, the nature of oral history requires that those providing the oral history offer accurate representations of the event(s) they are retelling. Thus, an oral historian’s ability to uncover the truth relies on the truthfulness of the testimonies they are provided. Bridging the gap between fact and fiction can, then, be difficult if oral historians do not have objective information to pull apart truth from embellishments and narrative-driven stories. Hip-Hop then, provides a unique challenge to historians as the information provided can be, and often is, only fragments of the whole story. Thus, retelling the origins of Hip-Hop is important not only to those who have a love for the genre, but also as a case study of the challenges oral historians face in their field. 
 

Add your content here, including _markup_ of **various kinds**. Now you can just write! But you should be aware of a couple of advanced features of markdown:
- you can embed HTML directly n a markdown file. This is great if you want to add complex attributes like **classes**, e.g. to your `img` tags so that they display properly (though you can also use the `{.css-selector}` method ddescribed in the main readme.
  - a particular use of embedded HTML is for funky javascript function links. I've written a simple function that will seek to a particular time code in seconds.  You can call it like this: `<a href="javascript:seek(75)">seek to 1:15</a>`, but `[seek to 1:15](javascript:seek(75))` won't render properly, so you have to type the whole link in, as seen here: <a href="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:15</a>.
  - also, markdown-it supports pandoc-style footnotes, which can be helpful sometimes. Here are some examples of footnotes at work:

    Footnote 1 link[^first].

    Footnote 2 link[^second].

    Inline footnote^[Text of inline footnote] definition.

    Duplicated footnote reference[^second].


[^first]: Footnote **can have markup**

    and multiple paragraphs.

[^second]: Footnote text.
