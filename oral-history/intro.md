# Origins of Hip-Hop
Since the mid-1970s, Hip-Hop has grown from a grassroots musical genre into a cultural phenomenon. Despite Hip-Hop’s growing influence on youth culture, there have been few academic historical studies which have examined Hip-Hop’s emergence. In their *Introduction* Alridge and Stewart (2005) issue a plea for historians to take more seriously the study of Hip-Hop as a cultural, political, economic, and intellectual phenomenon: 

> We encourage scholars to expand their efforts to include collecting oral histories of Hip Hop, identifying and preserving artifacts that document the evolution of Hip Hop, and developing flexible and historically derived frameworks through which to examine (pg. 194).[^first]

In response to this call for action, this paper, and the audio which accompanies it, attempts to contribute to the preservation and enrichment of the—historical—study of Hip-Hop. Generally, this paper works to highlight the *Old School Era* of Hip-Hop, the period between 1970 and 1985 where the four fundamental elements of Hip-Hop culture where developed: Disc jockeying (DJing), break dancing, graffiti art, and rapping (emceeing). Specifically, this paper uses a collection of interviews given by Hip-Hop’s founding fathers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Kool_Herc">DJ Kool Herc</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrika_Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_Flash">Grandmaster Flash</a>) and by important players in the founding of Hip-Hop (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_Caz">Casanova Fly</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bank_Hank">Big Bank Hank</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_Five_Freddy">Fab Five Freddy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Silverman">Tom Silverman</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melle_Mel">Melle Mel</a>) to provide a retelling of Hip-Hop’s genesis story. In addition, this paper aims to highlight some difficulties historians face when studying the evolution of Hip-Hop.
