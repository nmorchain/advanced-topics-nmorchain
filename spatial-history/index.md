# Redlining In Chicago

HOLC maps assigned a letter grade between A and D to each area. Type A areas, outlined in green, were typically suburbs on the outskirts of cities; Type B areas, outlined in blue, were considered desirable; Type C areas, outlined in yellow, were labeled as declining; Type D areas outlined in red, were considered hazardous and high-risk for mortgage support. Type D areas tended to be older districts near the center of cities and were often black and Jewish neighborhoods. This is reflected in the, often racist, descriptions and characteristics of the areas which the HOLC Maps describe. Take, for example, the description of a Type D area in Chicago: 

>>*Located between 35th and 67th, west of Cottage Grove to State, a blighted area, 100 per cent negro, predominantly apartment buildings…This project is expected to house 1,662 negro families and, of course, will be taken off the tax rolls with the exception of taxes for police, fire and school purposes. This venture has the realtors guessing as to what the ultimate result will be when so many of this race are drawn into this section from the already negro-blighted district…Already Washington Park at the south, a very fine park, has been almost completely monopolized by the colored race.. … With approximately 6,500 colored people moving into this district, it is evident they cannot be closed in; they must have an outlet; and the problem of keeping park and water frontage close by reasonably free of them will be difficult to surmount (Description and Characteristics of Area D74 of Chicago, IL).* 
	
The effects of redlining have been long lasting. Recent studies have looked into the effects of redlining HOLC maps and have found a correlation between areas rated Type C and D and racial segregation, low-home ownership, low house values, and poor credit scores.  This map aims to measure the effects of redlining on communities in Chicago by examining Composite Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. 

In the 2016-2017 school year, the state of Illinois made it a requirement for all high school juniors to take the SAT: the SAT scores in this map are from the program’s inaugural year.  While the SAT is broken into two sections, one math, one English language, the composite SAT score can be obtained by adding the scores from both sections together. For example, if John scores 640 on the math section and 500 on the English language section, his composite score would be 1140. 

The SAT composite score can then be used to determine a student’s overall performance on the SAT, and thus, can be used as an approximate for the academic prowess. According to the Illinois Board of Education, students with a composite score of 1310 or greater exceed Board standards, students with a composite score between 1080 and 1310 meet Board standards, and students with a composite score bellow 1080 are approaching Board standards.  

Of the schools mapped which meet or exceeded Board standards, all are preparatory schools. Meaning that, in order to attend, students must complete an application process and be accepted to attend. Thus, students attending these schools are not, necessary, from the area where the school is located. Take, for example, Walter Payton College Preparatory High School. While in a Type D area, it is less than a kilometer from Type A and B areas and, thus, is often a feeder school for families living in those areas. Of the students attending Walter Payton College Preparatory High School, only 31% are from low-income households. By comparison, 72.30% of students who attended Lake View High School, which has the fourth highest SAT composite score of those mapped, are from low-income households. What is more concerning is that Lake View High School is bellow the district average in terms of students from low-income households—77.90%. 

It is important to consider how the community in which students are raised effects their ability to perform academically. What this map shows, is that the students which belong to communities which were labeled as Type C and D—and thus undesirable—by the HOLC have since struggled with racial segregation, finical instability, and struggle academically. Only three of the fourteen schools mapped preformed at or above the state average of 994.5. The disparity is so great that even if the state average dropped by fifty points only four schools would perform at or above state average. 

This map reveals another trauma caused by redlining in Chicago. Type C and D areas have yet to recover from the damage done by the HOLC in the 1930s and 1940s. While this map only looks at a small portion of the City of Chicago District School Board’s 178 High Schools, it is immediately obvious that there is a correlation between schools which, on average, scored below 1080 and their being located in Type C and D areas. What this suggests is that the practice of redlining has had long lasting, adverse effects on communities in Type C and D areas.
