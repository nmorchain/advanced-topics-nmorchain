# Tracing the Effects of Redlining in Chicago through Student Performance on SAT

The Home Ownersâ€™ Loan Corporation (HOLC) was a government-sponsored corporation established in 1933 as part of the New Deal. The HOLC issued bonds to homeowners who were having problems making payments on their mortgage loans due to the Great Depression. To assess the creditworthiness of homes, the HOLC created maps (hereafter HOLC maps) which divided cities into areas and graded them based on the level of security for real-estate investments. 

A study by *Aaronson et al* has documented the adverse effects of redlining on communities. This map looks to highlight those effects by looking for a correlation between student performance and redlining.
